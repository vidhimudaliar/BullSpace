## How We Built It üî®
We built BullSpace using a modern tech stack that includes *JavaScript, **HTML, **Python, **Flask, and **Azure. We integrate data from **JSON* files, the *Canvas Instructure API, and **Firebase* for real-time updates.

Our approach was to simulate live CCTV footage using still photos. We compared an image of an empty library with subsequent images and employed *Microsoft Azure's People Detection ML* to determine which seats are occupied. These results are then updated in real time in our Firebase database, keeping the library map always current.

## What We Learned üéì
As first-time hackers, our journey was filled with challenges and triumphs. We tackled our biggest hurdle‚Äîlearning Azure‚Äîhead-on. This project not only enhanced our technical skills but also deepened our understanding of real-time data integration and user-centric design.

## What's Next üöÄ

We're just getting started! In the near future, we plan to expand BullSpace with exciting new features, including:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Enhanced Real-Time Data:*  
  Integrate IoT devices or more advanced computer vision techniques to further improve the accuracy of seat occupancy tracking.
  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Personalized Study Recommendations:*  
  Leverage more Canvas data and machine learning to provide custom study suggestions based on individual class schedules and habits.
  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Community & Collaboration Features:*  
  Add social features such as study group formation, peer-to-peer messaging, and shared booking notifications.
  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Voice & Chatbot Support:*  
  Implement voice commands and an intelligent chatbot to help users quickly find study spots or check their weekly to-do lists.
  
Stay tuned as we continue to refine and build upon BullSpace to make studying smarter and more efficient for everyone!
